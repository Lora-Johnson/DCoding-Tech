# She’s Good with Computers

My spouse and I were joking about the title of the post. On several occasions, this statement was uttered by older members of our respective families in reference to people that were knowledgeable about technology. 

When follow-up questions (such as, “oh, what does she do? or “where does she work?”) are posed, the answer is usually “I don’t know. She’s just good with computers.”

This simple answer speaks to how mysterious technology is in our modern culture. For something as ubiquitous in our daily lives as tech, most people don’t understand what tech entails.

The tech world is broad with a wide range of roles that cater to different aspects of tech, from infrastructure to development. Here are some common roles within tech:

Each of these roles can have specific sub-roles or specialties depending on the organization and its needs. But tech is constantly evolving, so new roles and areas of expertise continue to emerge as technology advances.

So, the next time you hear, “She’s good with computers,” you might want to follow up with, “Oh yeah? Does she build servers, fight off cybercriminals, or make AI that’ll one day take over the world?”

Tech isn’t just “computers”—it’s an entire universe of roles, from coding and cybersecurity to designing tiny circuit boards and keeping the cloud from crashing. It’s a vast, dynamic field filled with countless specialized roles—each contributing to the technology we rely on daily. Whether in software, hardware, security, or design, tech professionals shape the digital and physical world around us.

Understanding the diversity of these roles not only demystifies tech but also highlights the many opportunities available in the industry. So, if you or someone you know is interested in tech, there’s a place for you—no matter where your skills and passions lie.

Here are a few terms that I should have defined:
**Cloud** – A way to store and access data, apps, and services over the internet instead of on your personal computer or phone. This information (the data, apps, and services) are kept in a special storage space on servers (more on this below). So, if you use Google Drive, iCloud, or Netflix, you’re using the cloud. This definition scratches the surface of what you can do in the cloud.
**Network** – A group of computers and devices that are connected so they can share information and resources. 
**Server** – A specialized computer or system that provides data, services, or resources to other computers (called clients) over a network. It handles requests and responds with the appropriate information, making it a crucial part of the internet and many business systems – akin to a server in a restaurant.
**Software** – A set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. It’s the invisible part of a computer that makes everything work.

# Blog: On the 1s and 0s

“Hey, don’t you mean ‘on the 1s and 2s’?” 

If I were talking about DJing, you’d be right. But this is a tech blog, so 1s and 0s are the beats that make computing go. Like a DJ spinning tracks on the two turntables (each turntable, numbered 1 and 2, indicates which is which), computers work their magic using only 1s and 0s. But instead of beats and bass drops, 1s and 0s correspond to flipping (or not flipping) tiny electronic switches to create everything from emails to epic gaming experiences. So, let’s drop the bass (or in this case, the bytes – more on this later) and dive into the language of computers—binary. 

Binary is a number system that uses only 0s and 1s to represent information. Why only two numbers? Because at the deepest level, computers are just tiny electronic circuits that can only do two things:

* 0 = Off (No electricity flowing – think of a light switch turned off)
* 1 = On (Electricity flowing – think of light switch turned on)
  
You might ask yourself “How can only two digits represent all the information computers need?”. Well, it’s not just those two digits, but it’s the combinations of those 0s and 1s that represent all the innumerable things computers can do. 

Ok, we’re going to take a bit of a detour here.

Let me explain how the decimal system (the numbering system we use every day) contrasts with the binary number. 
The decimal system has ten digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9. When we count past 9, we combine these digits to make larger numbers (10, 11, 12, etc.). Each place value represents a power of 10 (1s, 10s, 100s, 1000s, and so on). So, the number 325 means (3 x 100) + (2 x 10) + (5 x 1).

Since binary only uses 0 and 1, when we count past 1, we combine those 0s and 1s to make larger numbers as well. However, each place value represents a power of 2 (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s, and so on). “Power of 2” refers to how many times you multiply the number 2 by itself. 

Now that we understand binary works in powers of 2, let’s break down how place values are calculated:

| Power of 2   | Calculation  | Place Value |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 2⁰ | The exponent is 0, any number raised by 0 is always equal to 1, so 2 x 0 = 1.  | 1 |
| 2¹ | The exponent is 1, which means 2 is used as a factor only once. So, 2 x 1 = 2. | 2 |
| 2² | The exponent is 2, so 2 x 2 = 4. | 4 |
| 2³ | The exponent is 3, so 2 x 2 x 2 = 8. | 8 |
| 2⁴ | The exponent is 4, so 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 16. | 16 |
| 2⁵ | The exponent is 5, so 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 32. | 32|
| 2⁶ | The exponent is 6, so 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2  = 64.| 64 |
| 2⁷ | The exponent is 7, so 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 x 2 = 128. | 128 |

Here are some decimal numbers and their binary counterparts:

| Decimal | Binary |
| :---: | :---:  |
| 0 | 00000000 |
| 1 | 00000001 |
| 2 | 00000010 |
| 150 | 10010110 |
| 225 | 11100001 |
| 255 | 11111111 |

Each 0 or 1 in a binary number is called a bit. Bits are grouped into units of 8 to form bytes. Using a baking analogy, sugar is an important bit in making a chocolate cake, but you can’t make a chocolate cake with only one cup of sugar. Other ingredients are required to make a chocolate cake; flour, baking powder, salt, vanilla, cocoa powder, milk, and eggs. 

So, just like you combine those 8 ingredients to make a chocolate cake; bits are combined in groups of 8 to form bytes – that’s why decimals like “0” are written as “00000000” in binary. Each byte represents something to a computer. 

Once you go past 11111111 (aka, decimal number 255), which is the endpoint of the 8-bit system, you move to 9-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit, or larger systems. And that, friends, is a bit more than what this blog post is going to cover in detail. 

So what do binary numbers mean to our computer? Here are a few examples:

1. Letters and Characters
Computers don’t understand letters and characters like we do, so they use special encoding standards (ASCII or Unicode) to represent them in binary. 

ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding system that maps English letters (A-Z, a-z), digits (0-9), and basic symbols to unique 7-bit binary values:
* “A” = 01000001 
* “B” = 01000010 
* “5” = 00110101
  
Since ASCII only supports 128 characters, it’s limited to basic English text.

Unicode, on the other hand, expands on ASCII to support characters from multiple languages, including Chinese, Arabic, emojis, and special symbols. It uses more bits (such as 16-bit or 32-bit) to accommodate thousands of characters:

* “A” in Unicode is still 01000001, just like ASCII.
* “日” (Japanese character for “sunlight”) = 11101010 00000000 01001010
* "😄" (Smiley emoji) = 11110000 10011111 10011000 10010000
  
These varying encodings allow for a balance between the efficient use of computer storage space and the need to represent a comprehensive set of characters.

2. Images
Every image on your screen is made up of pixels. Each pixel has a color, and each color is stored as a binary code. A common format is RGB (Red, Green, Blue), where each color gets its own binary value.

Pure red in binary looks like this:

* Red = 11111111 00000000 00000000 (Max red, No green, No blue)
  
RGB has its own notations of representing colors, so you would most likely see pure red referred to as (255, 0, 0) in 8-bit form or as (#FF0000) in hexadecimal form. While binary is the foundation, computers also use hexadecimal notation for more compact representations of large binary numbers. Hexadecimal is a 16-bit numerical system where numbers “0”–”9″ represent values 0 to 9 and letters “A”–”F” represent values from 10 to 15.

3. Sounds 
Have you ever wondered how music is stored digitally? It’s all just numbers!

* A microphone records sound waves as analog signals.
* The computer converts them into binary numbers by taking thousands of tiny samples per second.
* Higher sample rates mean clearer sound—like switching from an old radio to a high-fidelity DJ setup.
  
CD-quality audio takes 44,100 samples per second, meaning the computer stores 44,100 binary numbers every second to reproduce the original sound.

From your favorite songs to Netflix movies, everything in computing comes down to 1s and 0s, endlessly flipping like a DJ’s crossfader. So next time you send a text, stream a video, or listen to a beat; remember: under the hood, your device is working its own digital turntables, remixing binary data into something we can see, hear, and enjoy.

Beyond text, images, and sound, binary is also the foundation of programming languages and encryption methods that keep your online data secure. This blog post is just scratching (HA! Get it?) the surface of how binary powers computing.
