# She’s Good with Computers

My spouse and I were joking about the title of the post. On several occasions, this statement was uttered by older members of our respective families in reference to people that were knowledgeable about technology. 
When follow-up questions (such as, “oh, what does she do? or “where does she work?”) are posed, the answer is usually “I don’t know. She’s just good with computers.”
This simple answer speaks to how mysterious technology is in our modern culture. For something as ubiquitous in our daily lives as tech, most people don’t understand what tech entails.
The tech world is broad with a wide range of roles that cater to different aspects of tech, from infrastructure to development. Here are some common roles within tech:

The previous list focuses on abstract technology—things you can’t see or physically touch, like software or cloud networks. However, there are also many hardware-based roles in tech. Hardware refers to the tangible components of a computer or system—things you can physically interact with, such as servers.

Hardware-related roles are just as important in tech, especially as we continue to rely on physical devices for computing, networking, and storage. Here are some key roles involved in building, designing, and maintaining hardware:

1. Hardware Engineer
* Electronics Engineer: Designs and develops the electronic components and circuits that are integral to computer hardware (such as motherboards, processors, and power systems).
* Computer Hardware Engineer: Works on the physical components of computers, including the design, testing, and production of things like processors, memory units, and peripheral devices.
* Embedded Systems Engineer: Focuses on the hardware and software combination in embedded systems (like those in consumer electronics, medical devices, or IoT).
  
2. Systems Architect
* Hardware Systems Architect: Designs and structures the overall layout and integration of hardware components, such as creating the blueprint for how a computer or network system’s hardware components will work together. They need to ensure compatibility between different hardware elements.
  
3. Network Hardware Engineer
* Network Hardware Engineer: Specializes in designing and building network infrastructure components such as routers, switches, and firewalls. They ensure the physical devices that make up the network work seamlessly and efficiently.
4. Manufacturing Engineer
* Hardware Manufacturing Engineer: Works in the production process of hardware components and ensures the smooth transition from design to mass production. They deal with assembly lines, quality control, and optimizing manufacturing processes.
5. Field Service Technician
* Field Technician: Specializes in installing, maintaining, and repairing hardware systems in real-world environments. They may be responsible for setting up computers, servers, or networking equipment at client locations.
* Hardware Maintenance Technician: Focuses specifically on diagnosing and repairing hardware failures in systems, devices, and equipment.
6. Test Engineer
* Hardware Test Engineer: Responsible for testing hardware components and systems for defects and ensuring they meet performance, safety, and durability standards. This includes stress testing and quality assurance to make sure everything works as expected.
7. Hardware Designer (PCB Design)
* PCB (Printed Circuit Board) Designer: Designs the physical circuit boards that provide the connections for all the electronic components of a device, including computers, phones, and other hardware. They use CAD tools to design the layouts and ensure proper signal flow.
8. Power Systems Engineer
* Power Supply Engineer: Designs and develops the power systems that supply electricity to hardware devices, ensuring that the power requirements are met while maintaining energy efficiency and safety.
9. Hardware Quality Assurance (QA)
* Hardware QA Engineer: Ensures that hardware components, like memory modules, processors, and other devices, are built to spec and meet reliability standards. They perform tests on prototypes and production hardware.
10. IoT Hardware Engineer
* IoT (Internet of Things) Engineer: Specializes in developing hardware and integrated systems for IoT devices, such as sensors, smart devices, wearables, and connected machines. They focus on creating hardware that works efficiently with software to transmit data.
  
Each of these roles can have specific sub-roles or specialties depending on the organization and its needs. But tech is constantly evolving, so new roles and areas of expertise continue to emerge as technology advances.

So, the next time you hear, “She’s good with computers,” you might want to follow up with, “Oh yeah? Does she build servers, fight off cybercriminals, or make AI that’ll one day take over the world?”

Tech isn’t just “computers”—it’s an entire universe of roles, from coding and cybersecurity to designing tiny circuit boards and keeping the cloud from crashing. It’s a vast, dynamic field filled with countless specialized roles—each contributing to the technology we rely on daily. Whether in software, hardware, security, or design, tech professionals shape the digital and physical world around us.

Understanding the diversity of these roles not only demystifies tech but also highlights the many opportunities available in the industry. So, if you or someone you know is interested in tech, there’s a place for you—no matter where your skills and passions lie.

Here are a few terms that I should have defined:
**Cloud** – A way to store and access data, apps, and services over the internet instead of on your personal computer or phone. This information (the data, apps, and services) are kept in a special storage space on servers (more on this below). So, if you use Google Drive, iCloud, or Netflix, you’re using the cloud. This definition scratches the surface of what you can do in the cloud.
**Network** – A group of computers and devices that are connected so they can share information and resources. 
**Server** – A specialized computer or system that provides data, services, or resources to other computers (called clients) over a network. It handles requests and responds with the appropriate information, making it a crucial part of the internet and many business systems – akin to a server in a restaurant.
**Software** – A set of instructions that tells a computer what to do. It’s the invisible part of a computer that makes everything work.
